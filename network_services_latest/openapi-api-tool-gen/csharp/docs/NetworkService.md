**Name** | **string** | Name of the multi-point to multi-point virtual circuit. | 
**NetworkFeatures** | **List&lt;string&gt;** |  | 
**NscRequiredContactRoles** | **List&lt;string&gt;** | The configuration will require at least one of each of the specified roles assigned to contacts.  The &#x60;RoleAssignment&#x60; is associated through the &#x60;role_assignments&#x60; list property of the network service configuration. | [optional] [readonly] 
**PeeringdbIxid** | **int?** | PeeringDB ixid | [optional] 
**ProductOffering** | **string** |  | 
**State** | **string** |  | 
**Status** | [**List&lt;Status&gt;**](Status.md) |  | [optional] 
**SubnetV4** | **string** | IPv4 subnet in [dot-decimal notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-decimal_notation) CIDR notation.  | 
**SubnetV6** | **string** | IPv6 subnet in hexadecimal colon separated CIDR notation.  | 
**Type** | **string** |  | 
**BillingAccount** | **string** | An account requires billing_information to be used as a &#x60;billing_account&#x60;. | 
**Capacity** | **int?** | The capacity of the service in Mbps. When null, the maximum capacity will be used. | [optional] 
**ChargedUntil** | **DateTime** | Your obligation to pay for the service will end on this date. Typically &#x60;â‰¥ decommission_at&#x60;.  This field is only used when the state is &#x60;DECOMMISSION_REQUESTED&#x60; or &#x60;DECOMMISSIONED&#x60;. | [optional] 
**ContractRef** | **string** | A reference to a contract. If no specific contract is used, a default MAY be chosen by the implementer.  | [optional] 
**DecommissionAt** | **DateTime** | The service will be decommissioned on this date.  This field is only used when the state is &#x60;DECOMMISSION_REQUESTED&#x60; or &#x60;DECOMMISSIONED&#x60;. | [optional] 
**JoiningMemberAccount** | **string** | The account of the B-side member joining the virtual circuit.  | 
**PurchaseOrder** | **string** | Purchase Order ID which will be displayed on the invoice.  | [optional] [default to ""]
**MemberJoiningRules** | **List&lt;string&gt;** |  | 
**Public** | **bool** | A public mp2mp network service can be joined by everyone on the exchange unless denied by a member-joining-rule.  Public network services are visible to other members of the IXP, however only &#x60;name&#x60;, &#x60;type&#x60;, &#x60;product_offering&#x60;, &#x60;consuming_account&#x60; and &#x60;managing_account&#x60; are made available.  Other required fields are redacted. | [optional] [default to false]
**CloudKey** | **string** |  | 
**Diversity** | **int** | Same value as the corresponding &#x60;ProductOffering&#x60;.  The service can be delivered over multiple handovers from the exchange to the &#x60;service_provider&#x60;.  The &#x60;diversity&#x60; denotes the number of handovers between the exchange and the service provider. A value of two signals a redundant service.  Only one network service configuration for each &#x60;handover&#x60; and &#x60;cloud_vlan&#x60; can be created. | 
**ProviderRef** | **string** | For a cloud network service with the exchange first workflow, the &#x60;provider_ref&#x60; will be a reference to a resource of the cloud provider. (E.g. the UUID of a virtual circuit.)  The &#x60;provider_ref&#x60; is managed by the exchange and its meaning may vary between different cloud services.  |
